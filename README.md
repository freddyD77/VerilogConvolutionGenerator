# VerilogConvolutionGenerator
C++ file that generates adjustable system verilog code that implements a 3 stage convolution network.

The file will generate verilog based off inputs taken from the command terminal. Instructions on how to use the command terminal may be found in the readme.txt found in the src folder. A testbench for the generated code will also be generated. Note that the code used to generate testbenches was provided by the professor of the course.
